<p>
Great news folks! We've decided to create a product engineering blog for spreading our passion and love for making incredible apps
with anyone who is interested in building great products.
Our engineers, designers and product managers are eager and excited to share their ideas and experiences.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of our engineers, we think this is a great opportunity for contributing back, as we mainly use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open-source software</a> for building our apps.
</p>

<p>
Since this is our first blog post, let us take you on a short tour to see around.
</p>

<h2>Wait, what is Redbeacon again?</h2>

<img src="/assets/tardis.png">

<p>
Remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" target="_blank">Dr. Who's TARDIS</a>? If not, it's just a simple box
from outside that is actually a time machine and spacecraft that is <strong>way bigger</strong> from the inside, which is
pretty much like Redbeacon.
</p>

<p>
In case you've landed on this page wondering what we do: Redbeacon is an awesomely simple product built by a bunch of
<a href="http://redbeacon.com/about/team" target="_blank">talented and creative people</a> <strong>working smart</strong> for
<strong>changing the way people find professionals they need to make their homes better.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Illustrations are always better than words:
</p>

<div>
  <img src="/assets/rb-1.jpg">
  <img src="/assets/rb-2.jpg">
  <img src="/assets/rb-3.jpg">
  <img src="/assets/rb-4.jpg">
  <div class="img-info">Illustrations by Gamze Karayilanoglu</div>
</div>

<p>
You might ask, "so Redbeacon is a place where you get pros to clean your home?"
It's not just cleaning but every home-related task you need.
</p>

<p>
It's really fun to tell what your home needs since our legendary <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/request_services" target="_blank">request service</a> tool
understands simple sentences like:
<ul style="margin-top: 0px">
  <li>Unclog my sink</li>
  <li>Paint my living room</li>
  <li>Fix my roof</li>
  <li>Set up my new sound system</li>
  <li>Upgrade my electrical wiring</li>
  <br><i><a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/request_services" target="_blank">Go ahead and try</a> some of the things your home needs!</i>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
After you request a service, our <strong>magic matching engine</strong> sends you up to <span  style="background-color: #ffffdd;">4 competitive quotes by
  pros whose reputation are confirmed with customer reviews and previous work history.</span>
</p>

<p>
Oh, by the way, if you're only interested in learning <strong>how much the job will cost</strong>, we've built an intelligent
<a href="http://redbeacon.com/price-estimator" target="_blank">price estimator</a> tool for that, too.
</p>

<h2>I know kung fu. What should I expect from this blog?</h2>

<p>
Our engineering team have lots of things to share: best practices, code snippets, failures, experiments, optimizations, statistics,
problems and solutions...
The major percentage of our codebase is Python / Django. We would use Python to make our coffee if we could, seriously. So expect
to see a lot of Python here. Our frontend on the other hand is mostly Backbone.js and we've created some cool extensions that we
would love to share.
</p>

<p>
Before moving on to most fun part, here are some keywords related to our technology stack:
</p>

<p class="text-center giant-labels">
<label class="label label-info">python</label>
<label class="label label-info">django</label>
<label class="label label-info">twitter-bootstrap</label>
<label class="label label-info">jquery</label>
<label class="label label-info">backbone.js</label>
<label class="label label-info">ios</label>
<label class="label label-info">android</label>
<label class="label label-info">html5</label>
<label class="label label-info">sass</label>
<label class="label label-info">javascript</label>
<label class="label label-info">memcached</label>
<label class="label label-info">mongodb</label>
<label class="label label-info">mysql</label>
<label class="label label-info">selenium</label>
</p>

<h2>Talk is cheap. Show me the numbers.</h2>

<p>
Numbers are always fun (nerd alert). I've put some numbers together for seeing the big picture even clearer.
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">14</span> engineers in the US</div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">5</span> engineers internationally</div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">10</span> Nerf guns with hundreds of bullets</div>

<br>
Having developers outside the US gives us the advantage of receiving commits every hour of the day, generating this incredible punchcard.<br>
<img src="/assets/punchcard.png">
</p>

<p>
We are growing fast, and our codebase is expanding at blazing speeds and handle most of the introduced bugs with our tests.
We have <strong>Hacking Fridays</strong> completely dedicated to bug fixing,
unit tests and selenium tests. Hacking Fridays are really fun and challenging; engineers are divided into several teams and there is an
insane competition where we hold a record for fixing <span class="medium">152 bugs</span> in one day!

<br>
OK back to more numbers:
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">277,608</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">Python</span></div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">25,416</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">Java</span> for Android</div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">50,980</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">Objective C</span> for iOS</div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">70,779</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">Javascript</span></div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">38,057</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">Sass</span></div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">42,330</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">CSS</span></div>
<div class="text-center fact"><span class="semi-bold">185,715</span> lines of <span class="semi-bold">HTML</span></div>
<br>
If anyone's wondering, 3rd party applications, libraries and frameworks are not included.

<h2>What's your office like?</h2>
<p>
So far I've tried to explain what this blog is about, what we do, mentioned about our building blocks and tried to
give hints about how our culture is. Ready to see how our office looks like? Watch our video:

<h2>Erm... I think I've left the stove on</h2>
<p>
OK I know this is getting longer than what you would expect from an introduction post but like I said, we have lots of things to share.
I think I'll stop writing at this point and save my words for another article. On your way out don't forget to check out our
<a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/about/jobs/" target="_blank">job opportunities</a>.
</p>
<p>
SPOILER ALERT!!! Our next article will be about Database Locks.
