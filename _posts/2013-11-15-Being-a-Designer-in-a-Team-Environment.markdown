As a designer, it's easy to forget we're designing for others. We have trained our designer eye to see from a different angle, we see things other people don't see, we catch things someone else would miss. I have met many different kinds of designers, but we all have one communal virtue: We design to please others.

Many of you would disagree, but if you call yourself a designer, you're creating for someone else. Deep down you long for someone to say, "Wow, what a beautiful design. You're brilliant!"

Others love to voice their design opinions. Everyone has these, whether they are a designer or not. Some are just more vocal about it, and they tell the designer how it should be done.

At this point, the designer either succumbs to the feedback, or they voice their own opinion that it "should be the way I designed it in the first place." How do you, as a designer, deal with criticism? How **should** you deal with it? Sometimes we are put in bad situations, like a girl I knew in college.

I knew her when I, along with four others, was an ad designer for my school's student-run newspaper. There were business undergrads who took care of dealing with clients. We worked mostly on weekends as to not disturb our studies, and most of us would finish up our assigned ads on Friday to have the whole weekend for freedom. Sometimes there are changes made by the clients after they receive the first draft, and the requests are returned to the queue. Whoever gets to it first will complete the improvements, whether or not it's the same designer who initially created the ad.

The girl, a newly employed designer, had recently joined our team, and she created a few on her first week. One of the ads got sent back after she had thought she finished it, so another designer did the changes as per the client's instructions.

When the newspaper got released on Wednesday, she immediately flipped to the ad section and looked for her ads. Seeing that her ad was altered, she got angry and threw the newspaper on the ground. A bunch of us in her design class witnessed her freakout. She was extremely upset because it was her design that someone else changed. No one else in our group ever acted this way; we all worked on each other's ads all the time. She just felt especially passionate about hers. I'm certain she wouldn't have been as angry if she had changed the design herself or if they had consulted with her first.

In my current design team, we mostly work separately on our own projects. However, there are times when someone is out sick and someone else has to finish up the design. I don't mind someone else working on my design, as long as the end result makes sense and a lot of people agree with it. Communication with the team is key. When changing the design, approach the designer in person, and if that's not possible, email them personally. When your design is being worked on without your knowledge, a lot of time you feel like they've blindsided you.

In the end, most design elements are subjective ideas circling around rigid gridlines and processes. It's an "organized beauty" in which the layout is set up, complete with imagery, illustrations, icons, and typography. Behind each element, there is either a strong explanation or a weak one. The weak ones can be swapped or replaced. It can be used to your advantage when sacrificing objects to satisfy design requests. Design can be a satisfying puzzle – all the chaos and cluttered information fitting perfectly and presented in a way that anyone can read and understand.

My advice to all designers: Learn to trust others. Let go of your "child creation" – the design – and have someone else pamper it for you. A good bunch of designers will respect you and let you know what they have changed, why they have changed it, and ask if you agree with them. As for other team members working with designers: When voicing your opinion, try not to attack them, but rather ask them if they have considered other options. Sometimes designers stare at a design for so long, they refuse to see any other way. Give them the choices and allow them to see how improved the end result can be.
